<h1>Assignment 3 Instructions</h1>

Congrats to all the excellent work that you have done so far , now here is the next fun challenge, assignment 3. <br>
Here we are testing our use of collections in Java <br>

<h2>Question 1</h2>
<i>Traffic Lights</i><br><br>

Write a java program to simulate traffic and traffic lights. <br><br>

Here is what you need to do: ,<br><br>
The cars come randomly as they are being added to your collection of cars (in the traffic)
and <br>they can only go when the light is green or yellow , when the light is red they do not go.<br>
What this means is that throughout the time of your program running you will be generating cars randomly
and adding them to your queue , <br>regardless of the light of the traffic lights.<br>
You only stop adding the cars when your collection has 100 cars in the queue.<br>
The yellow light lasts for 10 seconds , the green one 30 seconds and the red one 20 seconds.<br>
When the light is green the cars go one by one (every second a car gets out ) <br>
When the light is yellow , the cars go  one by one (every two seconds one  car gets out ,
because yellow is for caution so the cars are going a little slower )<br>
When the light is red, no car gets to go . <br>
They all stay where they are. <br>
Your program only ends when all the cars in your collection are gone. <br>
Your random car addition can add up to 20 cars at one time<br>

<h3>Grading Rubric</h3>
This question is worth 80 marks ,<br>
Having the lights change in a nice sequence that you choose and respecting the time for each color  is 20 marks.<br>
Having the cars going out of the queue when the color and the time is right is worth 20 marks<br>
Having the cars stop when the lights are red is worth 20 marks <br>
Documentation and commenting is worth 20 <br><br>

If you do this all by yourself , you will be making a big step into becoming a good engineer so no plagiarism <br>
You can reach out to me if you have any questions ,and really have fun with this guys.<br>
And for those of you who are advanced , can you do a visual simulation of this ??<br>


<h2>Question 2</h2>
Write a Java program to copy all of the mappings from the specified map to another map.<br>
Test it with three different maps. <br>

<h3>Grading Rubric</h3>
This question is worth 20 marks.<br>
Having working code is worth 12 marks, <br>
Documentation and commenting is worth 20 marks <br>
